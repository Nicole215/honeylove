                <h3>The Burmann family welcomes you.</h3>
                <p>We took over our bees from a beloved relative more than 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>With no previous experience, it took a lot of books, the rest was learning by trial and error.
                    The learning however never stops.</p>
                <p>The beehives are spread all over the property. From two colonies directly under a lime tree,
                    planted for the bees, to 5 colonies under the fruit trees and bees at the edge of the forest, we
                    live
                    with and for the bees.</p>

                <h3>A year with bees</h3>
                <p>The bees are busy collecting honey and when the summer is over, you can harvest. Right? Well,
                    unfortunately no. The beekeeper is busy all year.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In winter, the beekeeper prepares frames for the honeycombs, repairs and cleans boxes or build
                        new ones.</li>
                    <li>In spring the beekeeper will plant flowers to make sure, the bees have enough to eat.</li>
                    <li>In summer the beekeeper has to harvest the honey. But also clean the honeycombs, exchange broken
                        ones and fill up the honey in glasses.</li>
                    <li>In fall the beekeeper has to make sure, his bees have enough food for the winter and are
                        healthy. The beekeeper also has to check the bees for varoa mites.</li>
