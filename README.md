# Honey Love
Welcome to Honey Love, a page about a local Beekeeper, his busy Bees and their Honey, which can be bought. This sites targets tourists to Torgau who quickly want to check, what to do next whilst strolling through the town. Typically those tourists are either cyclist traveling light or people of 60 years and older.

# Design
This site was designed with tourists on bikes and elderly people in mind. It was built with a mobile-first approach, as most tourists travel light and would access the site via phone or other mobile device. Therefore the site is clearly structured with the navigation bar open at all times to allow the users to grab the full content and it's purpose at a glance. The site has no educational purpose. Therefore the Bees page is focussed only on inmpressive facts to gain respect for the Bees and their work.
### Wireframes
The design and structure for this website was created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The designs produced were desktop versions only.

### Color Scheme
Brown and a light yellow were chosen as the colors to represent the colors of honey and bees. The brown frame around each content reminds of honeycomb-frames.
### Fonts
"Open Sans" was chosen for it's simple look, with a backup font of sans-serif. It was chosen for its unobtrusive look, what makes it easy to read. The font was selected from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
# Features
Honeylove is designed and structured to make accessing information as easy for the user as possible.
### Existing Features
#### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is present at the top of all pages of the site. It includes links to Home page, Bees page, Honey page and Contact page. It is fully visible in mobile version as well, to provide an overview of the content and make navigation easy.
The current page is highlighted with a brownish underline.
#### Video on landing page
I have decided against a hero image and instead imbedded a short video of the beekeeper working on the bees. The video gives a quick preview of what to expect during a visit.
#### Main Content
All main sections throughout the site maintain a consistent layout and styling. Whilest the styling reminds of honeycomb-frames, this design also makes it easier for the user to know which picture and information goes together.
Only the landing page sticks out by not having a frame around the information provided. 
#### Footer
The footer element contains 3 icons, linking to the main social media platforms.
The footer is consistent throughout all pages.
The icons are styled in the sites primary color.
#### Address and Map iframe
On the last page of the site the users can find the address with a map iframe.
#### Contact Form
Also on the last page of the site the user will find a contact form to fill in either a desire to visit the bees or buy honey. This is mainly to check availability beforehand.
Name and email are mandotory fields. 
Submitting the form will take the user to the form dump page provided by Code Institute.
### Future Features
Include shipping costs
To provide a better experience for vendors, I would include a table containing shipping costs.

# Bugs
In the dev tool preview for mobile both iframes, the video and the google maps, would overlap the fixed navigation bar. It did not do so on an actual mobile phone. Hoewever, the issue could be fixed be easily fixed using z-index.
