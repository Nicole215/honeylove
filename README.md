# Honey Love

# Design
This site was designed with tourists on bikes and elderly people in mind. It was built with a mobile-first approach, as most tourists travel light and would access the site via phone or other mobile device. Therefore the site is clearly structured with the navigation bar open at all times to allow the users to grab the full content and it's purpose at a glance. The site has no educational purpose. Therefore the Bees page is focussed only on inmpressive facts to gain respect for the Bees and their work.
### Wireframes
The design and structure for this website was created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The initial designs produced were desktop versions only.
![layout_main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfd5ae6a-b455-4301-a2e9-03ba48a605ff)
![layout_contact](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303407a1-ed4f-4856-90a7-8375f2e35ab8)

### Color Scheme
- Brown and a light yellow were chosen as the colors to represent the colors of honey and bees. The brown frame around each content reminds of honeycomb-frames.
- Colors were picked using Coolors

 ![colors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4d429d3-6e46-42b8-8648-0f47f4ad9a37)
- Contrast was tested using WebAIM

 ![contrast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d2159f2-f864-4606-b856-70d8d4512c58)

### Fonts
- "Open Sans" was chosen for it's simple look, with a backup font of sans-serif.
- It was chosen for its unobtrusive look, what makes it easy to read.
- The font was selected from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
# Features
Honeylove is designed and structured to make accessing information as easy for the user as possible.
### Existing Features
#### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar is present at the top of all pages of the site. It includes links to Home page, Bees page, Honey page and Contact page.
- It is fully visible in mobile version as well, to provide an overview of the content and make navigation easy.
- The current page is highlighted with a brownish underline.

#### Video on landing page
- I have decided against a hero image and instead imbedded a short video of the beekeeper working on the bees. The video gives a quick preview of what to expect during a visit.

 ![video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ba7933-ac04-487e-9c3f-3af2216753e6)

#### Main Content
- All main sections throughout the site maintain a consistent layout and styling. Whilest the styling reminds of honeycomb-frames, this design also makes it easier for the user to know which picture and information goes together.
- Only the landing page sticks out by not having a frame around the information provided. The intention behind this layout is, that the landing page is about humans, whereas the Bees page, Honey page and Contact page are focused on bees and bees products.

 ![main_content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cecf328-80b4-4bbf-944e-78976dc9594d)

#### Footer
- The footer element contains 3 icons, linking to the main social media platforms.
- The footer is consistent throughout all pages.
- The icons are styled in the sites primary color.

#### Address and Map
On the last page of the site the users can find the address with a map by Google maps.
#### Contact Form
- Also on the last page of the site the user will find a contact form to fill in either a desire to visit the bees or buy honey. This is mainly to check availability beforehand.
- Name, email and feedback are mandatory fields. 
- Submitting the form will take the user to the form dump page provided by Code Institute, which opens in a new tab.

# Deployment
1. I deployed the site via GitHub pages via the following procedure:
- From the projects repository, go to the setting tab
- From the left-hand menu, select the Pages tab
- Under the source section, select the Main branch from the drop-down menu, leave the folder on root and click save
- After a few minutes the page will refresh and provide a link to the deployed site
# Bugs
In the dev tool preview for mobile both iframes, the video and the google maps, would overlap the fixed navigation bar when scrolling. It did not do so on an actual mobile phone. Hoewever, the issue could be fixed easily using z-index.
